# Running-Tiny-Lanuage-Model-on-ESP32
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Tiny Language Model for NLP understanding on an ESP32-S3, compiled using the SynapEdge, prove that sophisticated, responsive AI can run on low-cost, resource-constrained devices entirely offline, enabling a new generation of private, low-latency, and power-efficient applications at the edge.
